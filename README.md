# Automate-Routine-Tasks-on-My-Computer
we are working on a new startup that requires a lot of compliance paperwork to be filed and organized. I’m looking to see if there’s anybody out there that has experience with using AI models or different programs that would allow me to automate a lot of the mundane routine tasks. Some of the task would include taking a PDF and then uploading it into our accounting system and transposing the data into creating an invoice. Other items are to generate sales reports from our accounting software, and then automatically emailing them to us on a weekly basis. If there is someone that has an expertise in this without doing a lot of custom coding that could teach us how to use several different programs or ideally one program. 
====================
To build an AI-assisted system that automates mundane routine tasks such as extracting data from PDFs, creating invoices, generating sales reports, and automating email delivery, you can leverage several no-code or low-code tools, as well as Python scripts to handle specific tasks. I'll walk you through some solutions and Python code snippets that automate these processes with minimal coding.
Steps to Automate Tasks:

    Extract Data from PDF (Invoice Data)
        You can use Python libraries like pdfplumber or PyPDF2 to extract data from PDFs.

    Transposing Data into Accounting Software
        Many accounting software options, such as QuickBooks, Xero, or Zoho Books, offer API access to automatically create invoices using the extracted data.

    Generate Sales Reports
        Use the accounting system’s API to gather data and generate a sales report.
        You can also use Python’s Pandas library to manipulate and generate reports.

    Automatically Email Reports
        Use email-sending services like SMTP or APIs from SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES to automate the emailing of sales reports.

Example Python Code for Extracting PDF Data and Creating an Invoice

We'll use pdfplumber to extract data from a PDF, and then generate an invoice in PDF format using ReportLab.
1. Install Required Libraries

pip install pdfplumber reportlab pandas

2. Extract Data from PDF Invoice

import pdfplumber
import pandas as pd

def extract_pdf_data(pdf_path):
    # Open the PDF file using pdfplumber
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        first_page = pdf.pages[0]
        # Extract the table from the first page
        table = first_page.extract_table()
    
    # Convert the table data to a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation
    df = pd.DataFrame(table[1:], columns=table[0])  # table[0] contains the headers
    return df

# Example: Extract data from the PDF file
pdf_path = "invoice.pdf"
data = extract_pdf_data(pdf_path)
print(data)

This code extracts data from the first page of a PDF invoice and outputs it in tabular format. You can adapt the code to extract specific invoice details like item names, quantities, and prices.
3. Generate an Invoice PDF

Once the data is extracted, you can use ReportLab to create a PDF invoice:

from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

def create_invoice(data, output_pdf_path):
    c = canvas.Canvas(output_pdf_path, pagesize=letter)
    
    # Set title
    c.setFont("Helvetica-Bold", 16)
    c.drawString(100, 750, "Invoice")

    # Set the invoice table headers and data
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 12)
    y_position = 720
    
    # Add table headers
    c.drawString(100, y_position, "Item")
    c.drawString(300, y_position, "Quantity")
    c.drawString(400, y_position, "Price")
    
    # Add each item from the extracted data
    for index, row in data.iterrows():
        y_position -= 20
        c.drawString(100, y_position, row['Item'])
        c.drawString(300, y_position, str(row['Quantity']))
        c.drawString(400, y_position, str(row['Price']))

    # Save the PDF file
    c.save()

# Example: Generate the invoice PDF
output_pdf_path = "generated_invoice.pdf"
create_invoice(data, output_pdf_path)

This code generates a simple invoice PDF with data extracted from a PDF and saves it as a new file.
4. Automating Sales Report Generation

You can generate sales reports from your accounting software by connecting to their APIs (e.g., QuickBooks API or Xero API). These APIs typically allow you to retrieve financial data, which you can then format into a sales report.

import requests

def fetch_sales_data(api_url, headers):
    response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    return data

# Example: Fetch sales data from an API (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.)
api_url = "https://api.quickbooks.com/v3/company/your_company_id/reports/sales"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_access_token"}
sales_data = fetch_sales_data(api_url, headers)

You can format this data using Pandas and then generate a report using ReportLab or Pandas' built-in export functions (to CSV, Excel, or PDF).
5. Automating Email Delivery

To send the generated reports or invoices via email, you can use SMTP in Python or services like SendGrid for better deliverability.

import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.application import MIMEApplication
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email(recipient, subject, body, attachment_path):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = "youremail@example.com"
    msg['To'] = recipient
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    
    with open(attachment_path, 'rb') as file:
        part = MIMEApplication(file.read(), Name="Invoice.pdf")
        part['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="Invoice.pdf"'
        msg.attach(part)

    # Set up SMTP server and send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login("youremail@example.com", "yourpassword")
    server.sendmail(msg['From'], msg['To'], msg.as_string())
    server.quit()

# Example: Send an email with the generated invoice
recipient_email = "client@example.com"
send_email(recipient_email, "Your Invoice", "Attached is your invoice.", "generated_invoice.pdf")

This code will send an email with the generated invoice PDF attached.
6. Automating Everything with a No-Code Solution (Zapier or Integromat)

If you want to avoid coding altogether and automate this workflow:

    Use Zapier or Integromat to connect your PDF storage system (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), and email platform (Gmail, SendGrid).
    Set up triggers such as "When a new PDF invoice is uploaded" or "When a new sale is recorded," then automatically extract data, create a report, and send an email.

Both platforms have intuitive drag-and-drop workflows and pre-built integrations for most common tools, minimizing the need for custom coding.
Conclusion

By combining AI-based automation tools, APIs, and minimal custom Python scripting, you can automate many mundane tasks such as handling compliance paperwork, extracting data from PDFs, generating invoices, creating reports, and automating email notifications. While Python is excellent for handling specific tasks, platforms like Zapier and Integromat can significantly reduce manual effort and streamline your workflows without needing extensive coding.
